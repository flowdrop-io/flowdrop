## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Theme system**: New `theme` prop on `<App>` accepts a built-in theme name (`'default'` | `'minimal'`) or a custom `FlowDropTheme` object. Themes bundle a visual skin (CSS tokens) with behavioral UI config defaults.
- **Skin system**: New `FlowDropSkin` type with `tokens` (light/base) and `darkTokens` (dark mode overrides), enabling full light/dark palette control per theme. Built-in skins: `'default'` and `'slate'`.
- **Built-in themes**: `'default'` (preserves original behavior) and `'minimal'` (dark slate palette with flat sidebar layout, matching the flowdrop.io demo).
- **CSS display tokens**: New `--fd-*` tokens to toggle UI variants without custom CSS — `sidebar-header-display`, `sidebar-search-display`, `sidebar-card-display`, `sidebar-flat-display`, `node-icon-display`, `node-circle-display`.
- **Flat sidebar layout**: Sidebar can now render nodes as a compact dot+name list (controlled via `--fd-sidebar-flat-display` / `--fd-sidebar-card-display` tokens).
- **`UISettings.theme` field**: Persisted user preference for the active theme (`'default'` | `'minimal'`). Existing settings without this field default to `'default'`.
- **`NodeSidebar.categoriesDefaultOpen` prop**: Controls whether category accordions start expanded in card mode.
- **New exported types**: `FlowDropTheme`, `FlowDropThemeName`, `FlowDropSkin`, `FlowDropSkinTokens`, `FlowDropSkinName`.

### Changed

- **Navbar action rendering**: `primaryActions` are now rendered exclusively through a split-button/dropdown. Previously the first action was rendered as a separate standalone button — consumers who relied on that distinct visual treatment will see a layout change.
- **Sidebar default layout**: The minimal/slate theme uses a flat list layout instead of the accordion card layout. The default theme is unchanged.

### Internal

- Removed JavaScript-based skin logic from `NodeSidebar` in favour of CSS token control.
- Theme resolution handles named base + inline token merging (e.g. `{ name: 'minimal', skin: { tokens: { primary: '#e11d48' } } }`).


## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- **Edge rendering**: Shortened edge paths to terminate at the arrow base instead of the tip, preventing visual overshoot at connection points
- **Duplicate workflow saves**: Fixed a bug where backends using UUIDs as primary keys would always receive `POST` instead of `PUT` on save, causing duplicate workflows to be created on every save. The fix detects existing workflows by the presence of an `id` field rather than matching a UUID regex pattern ([#26](https://github.com/flowdrop-io/flowdrop/issues/26))

### Internal

- Added unit tests for `globalSaveWorkflow` covering both legacy and enhanced client paths
- Added E2E regression test for the UUID-based workflow save behavior


## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-11
