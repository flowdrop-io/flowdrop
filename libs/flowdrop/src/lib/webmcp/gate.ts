/**
 * WebMCP adapter — approval gate.
 *
 * Tool calls that would change the document pass through here before anything
 * runs. The policy is the host's (`WebMCPOptions.approval`); the default is a
 * confirm dialog rendered inside the page, because the WebMCP permission model
 * is about which origins may *see* tools, not about whether a given call may
 * change the user's document. Any agent or extension on the page can call a
 * tool, so the gate must not be weaker than the chat panel's click-to-apply.
 *
 * Two ergonomics live here too. A batch shows a *summary* of what changes
 * (nodes added, edges connected, config keys set) above the line list, so the
 * person reads what the agent is doing rather than a verb list. And the
 * dialog can offer "apply further edits without asking" for the rest of the
 * page's life — edits only: `save` and `run` are consequential and always ask.
 * The gate cannot tell one agent from another, so the offer is worded as what
 * it is: every caller on the page is covered once it is ticked. It is still a
 * click-to-apply — one the person chose to make once.
 *
